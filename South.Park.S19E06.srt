PC PRINCIPAL: All right,
everyone. Listen up.

12
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:36,516
Today, we're gonna be
showing you some art

13
00:00:36,618 --> 00:00:37,951
from our Asian-American
students, and...

14
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,019
Damn it, Leslie! Shut
your [bleep] pie hole!

15
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:44,224
From our Asian-American students
presented by student-body president,

16
00:00:44,326 --> 00:00:45,225
Wendy Testaberger.

17
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,326
Hey, guys.

18
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:48,295
As you know, we have
several new students

19
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:49,629
here at South Park Elementary.

20
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:51,631
We have been getting to
know some of the Asian girls,

21
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:54,901
who have introduced us to
an art style called "yaoi."

22
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,370
Yaoi is a blend of emotion and beauty

23
00:00:57,472 --> 00:01:00,073
involving two people whose
love is looked down upon.

24
00:01:00,175 --> 00:01:02,609
The art tries to show
that all love is magical,

25
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:04,811
like in Lisa Akimoto's piece,

26
00:01:04,913 --> 00:01:07,380
"Tweek and Craig: Forbidden Love."

Kelly Zhou goes a bit more whimsical

30
00:01:11,753 --> 00:01:14,354

Dude, what the [bleep]?

33
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,311
In yaoi art, the  seme,  or "top,"

34
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:23,196
<i>Is usually dominating In is usually
dominating the  uke,  or "bottom,"</i>

35
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:25,794
as demonstrated in Heather Nishimura's

36
00:01:25,795 --> 00:01:28,004
"Tweek and Craig: Boizu Rabu."

37

"[Girls "Aww" and applause]"

38
00:01:29,838 --> 00:01:32,035
But yaoi can branch out
to other things, as well...

39
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:33,201
Uh-oh.

40
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:37,796
As we see here in "Lilly,
Frog, Tweek, and Craig."

41
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:41,096
I just don't get it.

42
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,030
I mean, Tweek and
Craig aren't gay, right?

43
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:46,063
No. We would know.

44
00:01:46,096 --> 00:01:48,863
Well, but then why would Asian
girls draw them like that?

45
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:51,030
Yeah, what is this yaoi thing all about?

46
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:52,863
I'm so co-confused.

47
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,796
And if it can happen to Tweek and Craig,

48
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,203
Could it happen to any of us?

49
00:02:00,936 --> 00:02:03,003
Uh, excuse me. Why are you doing this?

50
00:02:03,036 --> 00:02:04,070
Oh, hi, Craig.

What? What did she say?

54
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,036
I don't know. That was
Korean. I'm Japanese.

What is going on, huh?!

56
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:14,869

What if my parents find out?! Aah!

61
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:23,536
PC PRINCIPAL: All right, guys, I know
there's been a lot of rumors flying around.

62
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,170
Just wanted to check in, see if
you have any questions for me.

63
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:28,236
Why are the Asian girls drawing
pictures of us being gay?

64
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,970
What's wrong with being
gay? Nothing wrong with that.

65
00:02:30,003 --> 00:02:31,936
But we aren't. I'm not.

66
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,236
I'm not either!

67
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,236
That is completely irrelevant, okay?

68
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,070
What matters, and the
reason I brought you in here,

69
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:38,903
Is that you understand
affirmative consent.

70
00:02:38,936 --> 00:02:40,036
What's that?

71
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,536
If there is a romantic
relationship here,

72
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,736
You have to make sure
your partner is comfortable

73
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,416
With any sexual exploration.

74
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,603
Aah!

75
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:48,103
Now, in a gay relationship,
it gets a little trickier,

76
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,736
But you still have to follow
some guidelines, all right?

77
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,770
But I'm not gay!

78
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,103
I don't care about that, bro!

79
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:54,503
Tweek, if... and I'm only saying if...

80
00:02:54,536 --> 00:02:56,443
At some point, you wanted
to touch Craig's penis,

81
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:58,076
You can't just go
grabbing for it, all right?

82
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,010
You would need to say something like,

83
00:03:00,043 --> 00:03:02,406
"Craig, is it all right with
you if I touch your penis?"

84
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:03,683
Okay? Let's try it out.

85
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,643
No!

This shit's important!

88
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,610
Craig, can I touch your penis?

89
00:03:09,643 --> 00:03:11,710
Okay. Good. Now, Craig, you might say,

90
00:03:11,743 --> 00:03:14,410
"You may touch my penis.
I'm comfortable with that."

91
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,369
Or, of course, you could say,

92
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:19,443
"No, you may not touch
my penis at this time."

93
00:03:19,476 --> 00:03:20,976
No, you may not.

94
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,710
Okay. Now we're getting somewhere.

95
00:03:22,743 --> 00:03:24,476
Now, Craig, what would you say

96
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,176
If you wanted to take a
gander at Tweek's asshole?

97
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,076
Randy, you should have a talk with Stan.

98
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,776
For what?

99
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,743
I guess something
happened at school today

100
00:03:34,776 --> 00:03:37,676
Involving two of Stan's
friends [whispers] being gay.

101
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,910
What?

102
00:03:38,943 --> 00:03:41,576
Yeah, Stan seems really perplexed.

103
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,143
Wow.

104
00:03:43,176 --> 00:03:45,210
Our town has only had a
Whole Foods for three weeks,

And we already have our first gay kids.

Go ahead. Ask me anything.

00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,416
I just don't understand
how it's decided.

116
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,416
Ah, well, you see, it's a combination

117
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,550
Of genetic, hormonal, and
environmental influences.

118

makes the Asians decide

Who they're gonna make gay?

120
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,416
The Asians?

121
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,287
The Asians decide who's gonna be gay?

122
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:26,950
Uh, uh, yeah. Yeah, they do.

123
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,550
Uh, the Asians just, you know...

124
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:29,983
They just pick who they pick,

125

And, um, so it's the
way it's always been.

126
