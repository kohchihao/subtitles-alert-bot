Repository work in progress, will be done very soon.

A Telegram bot for download and subscribe to tv show subtittles.

### What is Subtitles Alert Bot

Subtitles Alert Bot is a Telegram Bot that let you download and subscribe to subtitles of your favourite tv shows. You can download subtitles for a specific episode or a set of subtitles, and manage your subscriptions. A subscription is referred to a specific tv show for one or more languages: once you have subscribed you will get your subtitles on your phone (also a direct link for others subtitles for all episode versions) without doing anything.

For its purpose we recommend to use the bot with [Telegram Desktop Client](https://desktop.telegram.org) or [Telegram Web](https://web.telegram.org/).
